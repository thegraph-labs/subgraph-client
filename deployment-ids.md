## üìä How to Find Current IDs

1. **Go to The Graph Explorer**: https://thegraph.com/explorer/
2. **Search** for the protocol you want (e.g., "Uniswap V3")
3. **Click** on a subgraph that looks active and well-maintained
4. **Copy** the deployment ID from the URL or subgraph details
5. **Test** the ID with our simple client

## üß™ Testing a New ID

```javascript
import { TheGraphGateway } from './src/simple-client.js';

const client = new TheGraphGateway();
const deploymentId = 'YOUR_NEW_ID_HERE';

// Test with a simple query
const result = await client.query(deploymentId, `{
  __schema {
    queryType {
      name
    }
  }
}`);

console.log('‚úÖ Deployment ID works!', result);
```

## üîÑ Updating This File

When you find new working deployment IDs:
